# CCR_kelp_feature_detection
This repo is intended to aggregate information regarding the testing of various feature detectors upon temperate, kelp forest benthic imagery.

A folder with 25 photos that exhibit a range of substrate and vegetation conditions for feature detector testing can be found [here](https://github.com/zhrandell/CCR_kelp_feature_detection/tree/main/photos).
